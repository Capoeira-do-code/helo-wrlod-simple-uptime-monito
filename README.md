# Helo Wrlod - Simple Uptime Monitor

This is my second project in github ( the first one doesn't work ). I basically made a simple not very functional tool to monitor latency and ping in a somewhat beautiful interface. All of that using python

## Usage
The tool is very simple to use. You have the main UI + a compact view, a button to add a host and having as many as you want and also a sorting to sort for uptime or latency. Auto-sort is kinda buggy so I recommend not to enable that option. Also I added dark mode, opacity mode
